Requirements

-- Two different domains.  You can use a subdomain of an existing domain if you like.
-- Able to deploy your own code (your localhost is fine).
-- Javascript :P

Demos

1) sender (sender.html)        
   Domain A sends messages to Domain B, but refuses to process any response.

2) Sender/Receiver (both.html) 
   Domain A and Domain B communicate with one another.

Please read the code comments for further details.

Errors

When incorrectly using jquery.messaging.js you will see errors appear in your
javascript console.  I recommend using Firefox or Chrome for ease of debugging.
